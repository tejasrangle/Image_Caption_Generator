# Image Caption Generator

Imagine a world where pictures not only paint a thousand words but also tell captivating stories. My project, the "Automated Image Caption Generator," does just that by bringing together the power of omputer neural network and natural language processing. Get ready to embark on a journey that marries images and words to create stunning visual narratives!
